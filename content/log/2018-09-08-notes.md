## goal

make it easier to contribute new tracks

## adding a track today

The [existing google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNmqKrn0QpUNlfief8nuNFCJxbN9VWynTnDO2aBdBZ_eEAzQ/viewform) will accept measurements for a new track. The entry gets saved in a google sheet. There are some calculations which get run in an enriched worksheet in that google sheet.

Generate a new page for the track using the `hugo` cli. I then move the values from the spreadsheet to front matter yaml in the new page.

## desired workflow

__one time setup__

1. sign up for free github.com account
1. fork the laps.run repo
1. clone your fork to local

__for each new track__

1. make measurements on new track
1. `git checkout -b add-uc-berkeley`
1. an undefined one-liner command to generate the new page
1. `git commit -am 'add new track UC Berkeley'`
1. `git push -u origin add-uc-berkeley`
1. open pull request on github.com

## one-liner command requirements

__inputs__

required:

- track title
- google maps url
- turn diameter (meters)
- shoulder to head (meters)
- track distance (meters, default: 400)

optional:

- elevation (meters)
- lane count (home straightaway)
- lane count (full lap)
- surface type
- surface color
- steeple water pit location
- track street address
- venue subtitle
- category: prep, juco, university

__calculations__

- A' (meters): diameter / 2
- C' (meters): shoulder_to_head - diameter
- B' (meters): square root (C^2 - A^2)
- A:B Ratio: (1-A/B) * 100
- speed rating: pi * diameter - (distance / 2)
- latitude: extract from google maps url
- longitude: extract from google maps url

*note: speed rating is pre-computed and saved in track front matter still because of a technical limitation. The inability to sort hugo pages in a list page using a computed field*

__output__

## one liner command

options:

- `hugo` [archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/)
- gnu `make`
- [mo](https://github.com/tests-always-included/mo)

feed raw input values into the command. run calculations. output the complete page.

## zoom out

this workflow still requires technical capability and tools in order to contribute a track. it is too complicated.

pure web workflow would be preferable.

## desired workflow revisited

__one time setup__

1. sign up for free github.com account

__for each new track__

1. make measurements on new track on google maps
1. input measurements into a web form. submit.
1. copy new track page content to clipboard
1. on github.com, browse to [desired parent directory](https://github.com/tphummel/laps.run/tree/master/content/track/us/ca) for new track
1. click "create new file" (which will automatically create a fork)
1. paste generated page from clipboard
1. click radio button for "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."
1. name your branch
1. click "propose changes"

## new track content generator

next step is for me to package up the calculations and page generation code in a way somebody can drive on the web. receive the inputs via a web form. output is the complete yaml text of the new page.

## bonus

more advanced could be to write a github.com integration which would drive the pull request creation when you submit the input form, rather than just dumping out the generated content. it would ask the user to authorize access to their github account to perform the necessary actions

## next

- [ ] add instructions to the tool/new-track page to complete the "add new track" story
- [ ] Build out instructions around the form
- [X] add optional fields to form
- [ ] test a few new tracks to iron out instructions and workflow
- [ ] A how to video screencast
- [X] Default distance to 400m in form
- [ ] Yaml validation for new tracks
- [ ] script to rebuild layouts/page/new-track.html from sub files
- [ ] run tool tests in ci
- [ ] heroku-style review apps for each PR. see your proposed changes deployed somewhere viewable
- [ ] elevation lookup using geo coordinates
