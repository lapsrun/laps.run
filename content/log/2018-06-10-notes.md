adding second measurements for all existing tracks. other new fields.
<!--more-->

#### second measurements

I'm going back through every track. making the second measurement and updating the google sheet behind the google form. Then, i'll update existing yaml for each track. then, we'll need to figure out how to present it.

- radius 1 (meters): half of turn diameter
- radius 2 (meters): new manual entry value
- radius percent difference: derived
- configuration: single-radius, double-bend a,b,c depending on radius match thresholds.
- then can we increase the accuracy of speed rating using the new measurement and configuration?

#### new fields for each track:

- apex_radius_meters: new value integer
- track_year: year of construction (optional)
- is_active: true|false (default: true)
- home_straightway_course: north, south, east, west. n-nw. s-sw. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_(navigation))

additionally, we'll need a way to link the lineage of a track. csu fullerton I -> II. prev, next (if set)
for reports we'll want to limit the reporting to active tracks only. unless we're explicitly including retired tracks.
