## Lapsrun methodology

Single radius tracks only. split/broken back tracks are not currently supported.
Turn diameter Inner rail to inner rail diameter measurements for purposes of lane calculations

Standardize on the iaaf terminology. “Double bend”

For the three double bend configurations in the iaaf manual, how different are the accurate circumferences vs measuring it as a single radius. 5-10% margin is acceptable. I’ll put that in the methodology doc.

very interesting paper, particularly re: speed around a curve.

1.2.3a - standard 36.50m radius.
(400-(84.39*2))/2 = 115.61

1.2.3b - double bend 1. 51.43m radius. 40 deg. 34.00m radius. 140 deg combined.
(2 * pi * 51.43) * (40/360) * 2 = 71.81
(2 * pi * 34.00) * (140/360) * 2 = 166.16
total turn dist: 237.97
total straight dist: 162.03

1.2.3c - double bend 2. 48.00m radius. 60 deg. 24.00m radius. 120 deg combined.
(2 * pi * 48.00) * (60/360) * 2 =

1.2.3d - double bend 3. (american football). 40.022m radius. 74 deg. 27.082m radius. 106 deg combined.
