Is there a way we can measure faster? Purely online? Yes. Google maps

Next steps.
Take first two tracks and build Hugo pages.
Simple template.
Partial for track page content referencing data in frontmatter

Frontmatter data:
Name
Latitude
Longitude
Distance
Diameter in meters
Turn lanes
Home straight lanes
Surface
Home straightaway heading
External urls: history, records, official

Are we generating ids for each track?
Url structure.
Tracks/name
Tracks/us/ca/name
Tracks/us/name

Tracks/<country>/<name>

Does Hugo have a permalink scheme?
Taxonomies and tags can emerge later
