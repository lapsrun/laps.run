# stickers

vinyl stickers for putting somewhere physically at a track denoting slow/neutral/fast

color pallette i like:
https://www.colorcombos.com/color-schemes/375/ColorCombo375.html

stickermule looks nice.
100 stickers x 3 designs. 1x1" circles. $118 total.

quantity per 3 designs	total	per unit
50	$105.00	$0.70
100	$118.00	$0.39

# rectangle geometry type

beverly hills high school is an interesting one. is there a way i can get a better geometry label? And is there a way i can get an accurate straights vs. turns measurements?

straightaways

37.84m x 2 =  75.68

68.43m x 2 = 136.86

straights 212.54

turns     187.46

a' 48.095

b' 32.000

yields:
- turn distance: 302.19
- straight distance: 97.81

-50.3%

# misc links

- [templated svg example](https://gohugo.io/functions/dict/#example-dict-with-embedded-svgs)
- idea: svg renderings of tracks based on their measurements. with start lines, relay zones, lanes, water jump, hurdle markers.

# track race ledger

on data.tomhummel.com

Then table of all 1500m races with columns.

1. Date

# ops website incept notes

Https://Ops.laps.run

Leave a build payload in main website as is ci.json

Record build payload and deploy payload. Push to s3 bucket before finish. Very final step

Trigger secondary job which rebuilds ops website based on contents of s3 bucket

Travis pipeline, triggered job

Or lambda job triggered by s3 event. Concurrency 1 based on arrival of new build or deploy in the s3 bucket.

This looks promising: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-stages

Ops site will contain build history, deploy history, and review apps

Would be good to get the build sha into the review app url, which I tried to do before. Which I think I can do I just have to script a deploy in the Pr build. Remove the existing deploy block. Do the deploy in the same script where I add the Pr comment. Needs an install of aws cli. This has to happen in the Pr build otherwise I don’t have the Pr number to build the url of the pr to comment on. The sha isn’t meaningful since it is a transient Pr sha but it will result in distinct urls and meaningful Pr comments which will continue to be usable after a subsequent Pr build happens. In case you want to review the previous iterations. Is there really no link between branch sha and Pr sha?

My ops dashboard needs to render everything as absolutes. No reference to the current date the page is being viewed. Relative dates could be a future enhancement with JavaScript. Just state the facts

The ops build will pull down all of the build/deploy/review data in the s3 bucket. Then a hugo config will build the site off of that data.

Single and list templates
* Build
* Review apps
* Review app deploys (nested) if no sha in review app url
* Deploy

Index
* Recent builds
* Recent review apps
* Recent deploys

Analytics
* Activity summary by week, month, year
* Duration trends
* Success/failure trends

Current build produces all data, and prod, staging deployments. Into a new bucket. Laps run ops data bucket. Turn bucket versioning on.

Secondary Travis stage build consumes from this bucket, builds ops site, pushes ops site to s3 bucket website. Eventually, remove ci.json from main website. Footer sha on home page links to ops website

Uptime robot public widget. Or pingdom,
https://stats.uptimerobot.com/68ZQYuzAx
Status.laps.run cname record
Ssl https://blog.uptimerobot.com/tag/status-page/

Ops.laps.run for my data
Status and ops links on footer

Status updates rss auto tweet? Deployments rss to twitter

* [ ] Create laps.run ops bucket, with versioning enabled
* [ ] Authorize Travis lapsrun user to read, write to ops bucket
* [ ] Push build.json
* [ ] Push deploy.json
* [ ] Push preview.json

Sunday

Get a basic site skeleton in place with a few of each data files pulled down.
Sync down the data bucket to data dir
See site locally
Create bucket, website
Create policy
Create dns
Deploy site manually
See a few iterations go

Stretch create time series data datasource for grafana
https://grafana.com/plugins/grafana-simple-json-datasource
The simple json api needs to be able to respond to queries defined in a post body. That will be tough or impossible to do. Querystring might be possible
If you can precompile queries based on common boundaries like days. Then limit the filtering you can do, it might be possible if you can get grafana to query with querystring or path. Holding for now

What cloudwatch metrics could be pulled in?

Csv load to google sheet. Pull in google sheet data via grafana or another dashboarding tool.

# page speed

[report](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=Https%3A%2F%2Flaps.run&tab=mobile). When will I need to [paginate](https://gohugo.io/templates/pagination/)? Hopefully not for a while. Key off my page sizes.

# taxonomies

Time to revisit. What candidate categories?

Can we derive taxonomies? Like bucket groups by elevation range based on an elevation value?

Most of the fields I’ve seen involve a single specific value be framed as part of a list of values

- Track colors
- Track surface type
- Steeple location
- Double barrel. If multiple heats of short sprints can be run concurrently on opposite sides of the track. Tag.

# Glossary copy

* Lanes - home: the number of lanes on the home straightaway. To be used for short sprints such as 100m
* Lanes - lap: the number of lanes that cover the full loop of the track. To be used for longer sprints with assigned lanes such as 400m
* Surface type: be as specific as possible. Mondo or crushed brick is preferred to artificial or dirt
* Steeplechase pit location: is the steeplechase water location on the inside or outside of the main loop. n/a means there is no water jump at that venue
* Turn diameter: the width of the track from measure line to measure line, starting from the common start/finish across to the opposite side
* Measure line. An imaginary line x cm inside the lane 1 rail. Which is used for measuring track features
* Apex turn radius. A line from the height of one turn down which exactly bisects the perpendicular line across the turn diameter. A single radius track has a turn radius (half of turn diameter) and apex turn radius which are roughly equal. Diasgreement between these measurements can either indicate a double bend track or a measuring mistake
* Geometry type

# todo

- [x] normalize speed ratings relative to track distance
- [x] Adjust calculations for double bend tracks. Adjust speed rating.
  - [x] if A:B > -20, subtract 6.5% from turn distance (1.2.3b/1.2.3d)
  - [x] if A:B <= -20, subtract 12.5% from turn distance (1.2.3c)
- [ ] establish single template
  - [x] compute total duration
  - [x] compute success/failure
  - [ ] link deploy from build (if exists)
  - [ ] link to github from build
  - [ ] link to travis from build
- [x] Trends in data for each type
  - [x] past 30, split into buckets of 10's
    - [x] success/failure rate
    - [x] total duration
    - [ ] build only: install vs. script phase
- [x] tweet ops dash link with emojis
  - [x] queue in buffer
- [x] tweet status dash link with emojis
  - [x] queue in buffer
- [x] speed badges
  - [x] speed rating svg for each track.
- [ ] create glossary content type
  - [ ] sort glossary list alphabetically
  - [ ] link to glossary for all fields on track single page. discrete "i". html elements dfn/abbr?
- [x] theoretical tracks
  - [x] fastest
  - [x] slowest
- [x] 5 tracks per week
  - [x] week of oct 14
  - [x] week of oct 21
  - [x] week of oct 28
  - [x] week of nov 4
- [x] move content of single page down below main single page template content
- [ ] list view update. table view sorted alpha
- [ ] tag for olympic venues
- [ ] tag for pac 12

  - [ ] sort glossary list alphabetically
  - [ ] link to glossary for all fields on track single page. discrete "i". html elements dfn/abbr?
- [ ] Add geometry to Wikipedia pages. Cite laps.run-
- [ ] Physics factored into speed
- [ ] Elevation factored into speed
- [ ] Calc speed rating for each lane. 200m, 400m. Might need to factor in lane width. Hopefully not
- [ ] Calc speed rating for each event. 100m: n/a.
- [x] Add open graph metadata tags to laps run
- [ ] Add twitter card tags to lapsrun
- [ ] Geometry report: Count, min speed, max, avg by geometry type. If geometry were a dynamic taxonomy that would be awesome

# social

Probably the best way I can grow viewership is to engage on social

Follow track teams, athletes, brands

Reply to tweets referencing venues with a link to my speed page

I want to have the physics component done by the start of next outdoor track season. Speed ratings by lane for 200/400m.

Setup insta
Setup Facebook

Follow teams. Reply after meet results

Reply to flotrack.

Setup a calendar of meets to cover. Saturdays run down my checklist

- instagram: lapsrun (no auto-post)
- facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/laps.run (@laps.run) - xml feed auto posts via hudson iftt
- twitter: @laps_run. ifttt auto posts from xml feed

latest: post to instagram with a screenshot of the new track, post to twitter, and facebook page via instagram app.

# other misc notes
---
- [ ] Turbolinks lighthouse results with minified from cdn
- [ ] Same with Embedded minified json in my template
- [ ] Content list views. Alpha, fast, slow, elevation. How close can I make those templates?
- [ ] Tagging and taxonomies. This is how I will accomplish filtering. Templates

- High school state championship venues

- Qr code on stickers with a link to fast/neutral/slow list or definition
- Physics of the turn
- Dynamic tags.
  * I can filter a slice of pages down based on a calculation, then print that list
  * Nicer might be to be able to do that in a pre-step

- Pretty track right on sac river. Up/down stream of the iconic bridge. Adjacent to a marina off the river

- Colors could be a good first taxonomy. multiple colors are possible (georgia tech, ucla). lets you group still. "give me every track with blue as a primary or secondary color"

# i18n

- https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/
- https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/tree/master/examples/multilingual/i18n
- https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#translation-of-strings
- https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n

I think my goal would be to maintain translations for key vocabulary, glossary terms. Journals would not be translated. glossary definitions could be translated be me or others

# a11y

laps.run as a testbed for a11y

Specification
https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/

How to do an accessibility review

Lighthouse chrome dev tools audits gives a decent scan

Chrome Extensions, which give even more detail:
- axe
- wave

interesting, structural things to fix on the page

a11y facets

* color blindness. contrast required
* keyboard only navigation
* complete blindness, compatibility with screen readers
* hard of hearing. limit audio cues.

- https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-builtin/
- https://github.com/github/accessibilityjs

# values

Minimal static theme

* Fast - small files. Low multimedia usage
* Accessible - works for as large an audience as possible. Visual impaired.
* Compatible/Portable - works on all devices, platforms, screen sizes. Phones, keyboard only.

General values

* available to as large an audience as possible. language, disability, technology
* easy to contribute. welcoming.
* connected. metadata enabled. scraper enabled. search enabled.

# merch

https://teespring.com/about
Sticker mule

Sticker mule links for fast/neutral/slow could link to top-level pages for those.

A definition followed by a table of tracks in that category

- Laps.run/fast
- Laps.run/neutral
- Laps.run/slow

# rankings

This track Is ranked

- 3/10 fastest in Indiana (95th percentile). Link to the Indiana list
- 75/160 fastest in USA (45th percentile). Link to the USA list
- 82/247 fastest in the world (37th percentile). Link to the world list.

Fast/neutral/slow is a fixed quality based on speed rating tiers/ranges, not on the percentile they happen to fall into currently.

- 100/110 n/a
- 200/400/4x100 rating by lane
- 800 rating by lane. 1 turn stagger
- 1500-3000 lane 1 rating
- 3000+ lane 1 rating

How to handle tracks shorter than 400 (franklin field)?

- how to build the rankings?
- for state/province, country, world. group tracks. order tracks by speed rating. get index. how to handle ties? simple rank might be enough.

this feels similar to how we build speed rating for list views. we build a slice of tracks enriched with speed rating. then order by.

and this is related to how i can get country lists, which i still havent solved.

the key is that i want the ranking data available on the single.html view.

my first attempt will be to do the ranking for a single track in the single.html layout.

# physics

http://www.batesville.k12.in.us/physics/phynet/mechanics/circular%20motion/an_unbanked_turn.htm

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_friction

My hunch is coefficient of friction on an all weather track in metal spikes is 1

- Iaaf track surface guide. https://polytan.com.au/download/IAAF%20Track%20Synthetic%20Surface%20Testing%20Specifications%20(MAR%202011).pdf
- Measuring Coefficient of Static Friction: http://physics.bu.edu/~duffy/semester1/c6_measuremus.html
- IAAF Certified Tracks. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x3RQKM0XVOEVUiw7LraP24qzb17QKwvs
- We should make a calculator with some different friction coefficient. Radius. Max speed.
- What I want to arrive at is the cost of a particular turn in energy compared to running a straightaway.
- The feeling of being thrown outward is due to inertia. How do we measure inertia and the resulting force required to counteract it?
- Centripetal force = mass * velocity ^2 / radius of turn.
- Theoretical max speed on a curve (units/s)
- Square root of (Friction coefficient x turn radius x gravity)
- Rotational inertia = mass * radius ^2
- The force to counteract the force will be equal to the force.

# dec 8 notes

things to track on all builds:

* [x] count number of lines in all html files
* [ ] count number of html files
* [x] count size of the list all tracks page
* [ ] hugo build time

```
find public/ -name '*.html' | xargs wc -l | grep total
  329716 total
```

compare line count to count on current production. shouldn't be greater than x percent.

- [ ] add html loc, all tracks file size to recent builds if set.
- [x] add html loc, all tracks file size to individual build page if set
- [x] publish latest notes page, with anything unpublished from evernote
- [ ] bump timestamps for all queued track prs
- [ ] queue up next tracks, milestones
