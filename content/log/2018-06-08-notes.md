Tasks

- [ ] Add country and state columns to global speed list. Links.

Headless CMS tools:

- https://www.contentful.com/
- Built.io
- Prismic.io
- Cloud cms
- Dato cms

These tools are interesting but I’m looking for a workflow that bolts onto my existing process. I don’t want a separate service to hold my content, I want it in git (hub/lab)

Workflow idea

Google form to sheet. Macro to generate yaml body from a single row

A web form which outputs new post yaml.
I can copy paste easily from there

Or, I can open a pull request from there. Pull request will need to know the path where the file will live.
Programmatically tee up the pull request for the user to authorize via their github account
Will need info to build the file name.
