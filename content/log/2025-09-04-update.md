- I cut over the website hosting from AWS S3 to Cloudflare Workers/Pages
- I'm using Cloudflare Workers Builds now instead of Travis CI to build and deploy. 
- I tried upgrading Hugo from 0.48 to 0.148.1, got errors, then reverted back to 0.48. 
- I removed Google Analytics.
- I removed references to the Ops website, the Status page. The DNS entries still exist for those but I'm not planning to keep using them. 
- I added two new tracks to prove new tracks could be added. 

It is fun to be back!
