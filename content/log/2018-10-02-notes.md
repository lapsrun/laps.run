#### speed ratings

- [x] fill elevation for all tracks
- [ ] normalize speed ratings relative to track distance
- [ ] Adjust calculations for double bend tracks. Adjust speed rating.
  - [ ] if A:B > -20, subtract 6.5% from turn distance (1.2.3b/1.2.3d)
  - [ ] if A:B <= -20, subtract 12.5% from turn distance (1.2.3c)

- [x] blog post on dynamic field sorting

#### turbolinks

turbolinks is a really slick javascript library. a very light touch which eliminates the jittery page loads. the lighthouse results were worse for initial page load with the turbolinks script added. we could try optimizing that. minified, embedded. as long is it degrades to the current behavior, i don't think there is much downside. i need to check that google analytics tracks correctly with the history api navigation. i would assume it does. i still feel hesitant for reasons i'm not 100% sure of.

### content list views

- if sub sections, list in a compact way
- all list views show all child tracks at any level
- alternate views with column sorting. header links
- csv export updated to match, all child tracks only. not sections.

### adsense

- i added the snippet to `_default/baseof.html` and it wasn't approved.
- i moved the snippet to only be on the fastest tracks list. the most informational view on the site. we'll see what happens.

### build/deploy reporting

- [ ] every build, push up a json file to s3 in the build/ directory
- [x] every deployment, push json file to s3 in deploy/
- i've got a wip branch for profiling the travis build, adding timers. needs a little more work to gather up the timers at the end and get them into the json. this would apply to builds and deploys

with all the build data sitting in files in deploy/ and build/, i want a better way to look at them. there is no way to browse a list of the builds. there is no server file listing on s3 websites. i probably need to consume all the files in each directory and render out a listing page.

- s3 event -> render html in lambda fn?
- rebuild on a cron
- can't append to the html file in s3, or edit inplace. have to pull it down, edit, push. at that point, might as well rebuild it

there is no backup of the files in deploy/ or build/. they are not in version control and versioning is not on in the bucket. that is fine for now i think.
