# S3 Usage Cost Increases

At the end of 2018, I was seeing steady increase in my s3 bill for [laps.run](https://laps.run) static websites. Using an export of csv data from the billing portal and a pivot table, I was able to determine that the `PutObject` API action was causing the increase. I determined automated deploys from travis ci are the primary driver of `PutObject` calls. At the time of writing, S3 Standard pricing for `PutObject` calls is us-east-1 is $.005/1000 requests.

**Month**|**Total Deploys**|**PutObject Cost**|**Cost per Deploy**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
2018-10|351|$0.48|$0.0014
2018-11|217|$0.53|$0.0024
2018-12|273|$0.89|$0.0033

# Deploy Methods

Per deploy costs were rising while the rough quantity of deploys has not substantially changed. The number of files to be deployed each time was steadily growing. And travis ci's [s3 deployment method](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/s3/) does the equivalent of `s3 cp`, thus doing a `PutObject` for files which are already in the bucket and have not changed.

# Deploy Improvements

[Opting out](https://github.com/lapsrun/ops.laps.run/commit/4b4c47140a7185d351c1871b20087cde6668e77b) of Travis S3 Deploy and instead using aws cli to do an `s3 sync`, I believed I could reduce the number of `PutObject` operations I was doing.

# Billing Improvements

After making the change on January 6:

**Month**|**Total Deploys**|**PutObject Cost**|**Cost per Deploy**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
2019-01|213|$0.31|$0.0015
2019-02|212|$0.23|$0.0011
2019-03|244|$0.28|$0.0011

Cost per deploy has stabilized even as my projects continue to grow the number of deployed files.
