detailed step by step workflow for adding a track.
<!--more-->

goal is to streamline/automate as much of this as possible.

1. find the track on google maps. zoom as tightly as possible. copy the url.
1. browse to the [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNmqKrn0QpUNlfief8nuNFCJxbN9VWynTnDO2aBdBZ_eEAzQ/viewform)
1. enter all values. leave elevation blank.
1. for "Note" enter the name of the track and/or field if known. then the street address of the venue.
1. submit the form
1. a derived google sheet tab computes speed rating, latitude, and longitude from the raw inputs.
1. move to your local checkout/fork of the laps.run git repo.
1. `git checkout -b add-track-xyz`
1. `hugo new track/us/ca/xyz.md`
1. correct the `title` field in front matter if formatted strangely.
1. add "prep", "juco", or "university" to `tags` as applicable to the venue.
1. migrate values from google sheet to the yaml front matter.
1. skip elevation_meters for now
1. put the `note` value between `---` and `<!--more-->`
1. save the file.
1. lookup the elevation: `./bin/yaml-to-elev.sh content/track/us/ca/xyz.md`
1. take the output of the script run and paste it into `elevation_meters` (rounded to two decimal places)
1. save the file.
1. `git add content/track/us/ca/xyz.md`
1. `git commit -m "add new track xyz (ca)"`
1. `git push -u origin add-track-xyz`
1. browse github.com. open a new pull request targeting tphummel/laps.run master branch
1. update the branch on the PR page if behind current master.
1. merge pull request
1. browse to next pull request and update.

how to get yaml out of my google sheet quickly?

example csv->yaml converter: https://www.browserling.com/tools/csv-to-yaml

i could create a derived google sheet tab which crafted the column headers to match my yaml format. get rid of other columns and i could drop it in. of course i could do this via a command line tool as well. non-sensitive information so web based is a fast way to try it out.

this smells a little funny. my data starts as csv via google form. then i do a bunch of work to make it yaml. so i ultimately can download it as csv again.
