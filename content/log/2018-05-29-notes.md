Methodology tweaks:

1. The 5-12% error margin for double bend tracks. Does this make them faster or slower than our measurements? Simple measure credits more Turn distance than actual, which makes them appear faster.
2. add a format field to each track. Single-radius vs double-bend. If double bend, show error margin note on page. Or even correct the speed rating with an asterisk
3. if there is a soccer field or American football field in the infield is it safe to say it is always a double bend track?
