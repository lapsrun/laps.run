- [x] if you enter an optional google maps api token, an elevation lookup will be run. can i set 1password or chrome to autofill it?
- [x] Fetch api? https://gist.github.com/mjackson/e1996e4d6205e313ea0b

New track Tool plan

- [ ] Move core js code to separate github repo. Tests. Target nodejs. Publish to npm in ci
- [ ] Add optional elevation lookup if api key set. Core http
- [ ] consume npm module in a script. All dom code there. Read in. Write out.
- [ ] Browserify
- [ ] Browserify that script during ci build

Roadmap

Google analytics in prod only:

- [x] https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/blob/master/themes/gohugoioTheme/layouts/_default/baseof.html#L36
- [x] https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/blob/master/themes/gohugoioTheme/layouts/partials/gtag.html
- [ ] Ads
- [ ] Share on reddit
- [x] Share on letsrun
- [ ] Glossary
- [ ] /Metrics (prom)
- [ ] /metrics.json
- [ ] Deployment journal append a line each Travis deploy csv or ldjson
- [ ] Pace calculator
- [ ] Move new track, pace calc to lambda
- [ ] Append to s3 file with aws nodejs
- [ ] Link my pages to Wikipedia pages for venues
- [ ] Add detail of the shoulder to head measurement to speed methodology
- [ ] Move fastest, slowest links higher on index
- [ ] Add elevation to fastest/slowest
- [ ] Ci/cd: check yaml. Required fields in new tracks are present. Speed rating isn’t out of possible range
- [ ] Ci/cd: review apps. Temp page deployed for every Pr. Google analytics disabled. Robots.txt ignore. Drop link into Pr as comment. Auto expire. Custom path prefix. Paste expiration info in Pr also. Turn off ads. Turn off rss feed. Make sure no auto tweet
- [ ] https://about.gitlab.com/2016/08/26/ci-deployment-and-environments/
- [ ] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/blog-posts/issues/350
- [ ] https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/
- [ ] Separate s3 bucket which holds all branches with path prefix. Age out by path. Branch/sha
- [ ] Ci/cd: store all deployment events in a single file as csv or ldjson
- [ ] Interesting tracks. Elac Near UCLA Two mid city. One a square with a baseball stadium inside One in the shadow of dodger stadium Just west of 110 on approach. Red circular
- [ ] Taxonomies. Taxonomies Country Track color Track surface Lanes Lanes lap Steeple water location.
- [ ] Webmaster tools
- [ ] Adsense
- [ ] Make list views show all tracks every level down. Track should show all countries. Us should show all states
- [ ] Get section values and show as columns. Country/state
- [ ] Adjust calculations for double bend tracks. Adjust speed rating.
- [ ] if A:B > -20, subtract 6.5% from turn distance (1.2.3b/1.2.3d)
- [ ] if A:B <= -20, subtract 12.5% from turn distance (1.2.3c)
- [ ] Track built date. Age. Resurfaced. Retired. Lineage of tracks
- [ ] post on flotrack
- [ ] Glossary and links
- [ ] List.csv. Iterate through all keys rather than specifying one by one
- [ ] “Freak show” tag for odd tracks
- [ ] Reconcile our large count of single radius tracks. Is there a way to sanity check based on turn diameter/width?

Review app plan

- [ ] Add production flag to turn on/off ga. Default off
- [ ] if not prod add an ignore robots.txt
- [ ] Create new bucket website with terraform
- [ ] do local build on a feature branch with prod off
- [ ] manual push to staging s3 bucket
- [ ] test url in browser
- [ ] Basic review app completed



- [ ] Next steps: reconcile pr commit vs individual commit. I want to get the sha into the Pr comment link. To have separate review apps per commit. But pr sha is a hypothetical sha that doesn’t match my branch commit shas. So the same commit that makes the Deploy needs to be the one that writes the Pr comment. Or does it? Are both shas available as Travis env vars during the Pr build?
- [ ] Add more detailed log messages
- [ ] Play with it a little during the week as I add tracks.
- [ ] Need to think how timestamps on posts will need to be once things get more collaborative. How to sequence properly? Final step before merge is an admin updating timestamp to current . Do not use git timestamp unless we want that to reorder tracks. Becomes updated timestamp instead of created at. That might be what I want for tracks actually. AuthorDate
- [ ] Add Hugo build info to ci.json
- [ ] Master deployment leger. Sequential files in s3 bucket. One for each deployment. The process those files with s3 -> lambda
- [ ] Why didn’t Purdue get tweeted? It is correct in the xml feed. Need to check ifttt
- [ ] Allow google maps api from staging domain
