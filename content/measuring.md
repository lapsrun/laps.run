How to measure a track.

<!--more-->
Find the venue in Google Maps. Zoom the map. Then right click the inner line/rail of lane one.

Choose "Measure Distance" from the context menu.

Then, click on the inside line of lane one across the infield from the first point. A box will open at the bottom of your screen with measurement in meters.

Note: This measuring technique will work for single-radius and double-bend tracks. Unconventional tracks such as square or pentagon shaped tracks are not currently supported. The track must have a common start/finish line.

Note: Take advantage of any reference lines on the infield, such as a soccer penalty box or football yardage lines. These will help your measurement line be as straight/perpendicular as possible.  

Note: For simplicity/standardization our measurements are from the inner line/rail of lane one rather than the imaginary "measure line" in the IAAF rule book, which can be 10-30 cm out from the inner line of lane one.

Note: Zoom the map as far as you can while still keeping both inner edges of lane one in the window. This will make the precision as high as possible.
