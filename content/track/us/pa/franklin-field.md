As of its [2015 resurfacing](https://www.phillymag.com/be-well-philly/2015/10/08/franklin-field-new-track/), Franklin Field's lanes 1-3 are shorter than 400m. I measured on google maps that lane 1's 400m starting line is 20.08 meters behind the common start-finish line. I use the normal measurment process on lane 1 and have set the track distance to be 379.92m.
